## For Devs

- MANUALLY UPDATE the flowchart data from the parser.
  - PLEASE DO NOT use git submodules to do so since it's ugly and somehow makes vite to behave weird.

## Get Started

To start development or to try it yourself, run the commands below:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
npm run dev_local # exposed on 0.0.0.0
```
