  "PlayerChoice.1-2.30.": "What?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-2.35.": "Slow down!",
  "AliyaMessage.1-2.15.": "Sorry, we’re pretty far out here",
  "AliyaMessage.1-2.16.": "You’d need to raise your ship's warp level pretty high",
  "AliyaMessage.1-2.17.": "Fuel costs alone would be astronomical",
  "AliyaMessage.1-2.18.": "Now that I think about it, it's probably not very realistic for you",

  "PlayerChoice.1-2.33.": "What?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-2.36.": "Slow down!",
  "PlayerChoice.1-2.37.": "Stop!!!",

  "AliyaMessage.1-2.27.": "Sorry, I got a bit too excited\\nPlease, you go first",
  "PlayerChoice.1-2.49.": "You’re not trying to scam me, are you? The more you say, the more ridiculous this sounds",
  "PlayerChoice.1-2.119.": "I’m starting to doubt what you’re saying. You’re not scamming me, are you?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-2.47.": "Are you just playing some kind of space role-playing game with me?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-2.48.": "I want to help you, but are you really sure you're in actual danger in space?",

  "AliyaMessage.1-2.76.": "Why are you questioning me like this?",

  "AliyaMessage.1-3.2.": "The fact that COSMOS suddenly turned into a human signal is weird enough\\nlet alone the fact that the signal is from nearly 1000 years ago",
  "AliyaMessage.1-3.4.": "……",
  "PlayerChoice.1-3.95.": "I just called you a scammer earlier… I’m really sorry about that",

  "AliyaMessage.1-3.131.": "I'm really grateful \\nthat you're willing to believe me and talk with me now",
  "AliyaMessage.1-3.133.": "And you helped me save Kane earlier\\nI should be thanking you instead",
  "AliyaMessage.1-3.101.": "It’s not your fault\\nI was just too excited earlier\\nI was terrified no one would come to save me",
  "AliyaMessage.1-3.118.": "Even though you’re not COSMOS\\nyou still helped me save Kane, didn’t you?\\nI’m really grateful for that",
  "AliyaMessage.1-3.123.": "But calling me a scammer… it still kind of stings\\nAt least we cleared up the misunderstanding in the end",
  "AliyaMessage.1-3.127.": "COSMOS would’ve told me the right way to save Kane right away\\n……\\nSorry, that’s not fair\\nI should blame myself for not paying more attention during the training",
  "AliyaMessage.1-3.149.": "But calling me a scammer… it still kind of stings\\nAt least we cleared up the misunderstanding in the end",
  "AliyaMessage.1-3.116.": "It’s okay\\nIf someone suddenly told you they were stranded in space\\nyou’d probably have a hard time believing it",
  "AliyaMessage.1-3.125.": "Do you still not believe me?\\nFine\\nHold on a moment\\nI’ll be back in a minute",

  "AliyaMessage.1-3.186.": "Uh…\\nbut it just happened\\nright?\\nThis small meteorite caused quite some damage to the Otter",

  "AliyaMessage.1-3.211.": "Yes\\nBut maybe if I repair the power reactor in the engine room, the ship could be able to move\\nJust enough to avoid being pulled by Koranth 2-B’s gravity and crashing\\nWithout the warp drive, though\\nwe can’t even reach the nearest star\\nlet alone the nearest human settlement\\nBesides the engine room issue\\nthe oxygen generator’s shutdown is also tricky\\nI’m not sure how long the remaining oxygen will last\\nAnd the incubation chamber is losing temperature due to the power outage\\nUgh… this is so frustrating",
  "AliyaMessage.1-3.214.": "Right now, both the engine room and the oxygen generator have issues\\nThe temperature control in the incubation chamber seems to have lost power\\nIf the engine room isn’t fixed\\nAt this rate, the Otter will crash into Koranth 2-B in a short while\\nAnd the oxygen generator has completely stopped working\\nI don’t know how much longer the remaining oxygen will last\\nThe incubation chamber isn’t as urgent, but there are important samples inside\\nEven if we solve all that, the warp drive is totally unusable\\nUgh… this is so frustrating",

  "PlayerChoice.1-4.1.": "Your life is the most important thing right now, so go check on the oxygen generator’s condition",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.2.": "Going to the engine room first is probably the best choice",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.3.": "As a research team member, I assume the incubation chamber is important to you. Let’s check there first",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.7.": "Alright\\nI’ll head there right away",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.8.": "That does sound urgent\\nThe temperature in the incubation chamber is also affected by the engine room\\nI’ll check the engine room first to get more details",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.10.": "Yeah\\nI’d better hurry up",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.12.": "No time to hesitate, I’ll check the incubation chamber first",

  "PlayerChoice.1-4.105.": "Alright, let’s hurry. There’s still a lot to handle",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.19.": "Alright\\nI’m at the oxygen generator\\nShoot\\nThe CO?-to-water converter is completely broken",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.21.": "But the water electrolysis part just has a few minor issues\\nShould be able to fix it quickly",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.22.": "Good thing I came here first",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.25.": "Alright\\nI’m here at the oxygen generator\\nLooks like…",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.27.": "It’s just some minor issues\\nShould be able to fix it soon",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.28.": "Glad I didn’t waste much time before this\\nJust in time",

  "AliyaMessage.1-4.42.": "Don’t get too full of yourself over there",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.43.": "Alright, the outer casing is open\\nNext is…",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.50.": "Uh…\\nThere’s a problem\\nI just fixed the malfunction\\nBut the oxygen generator still isn’t working\\nThat’s odd\\nIt should be functioning without any issue",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.52.": "Did you press the start button of it?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.53.": "Just double-check it",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.59.": "How could I make that kind of mistake?\\nWait…",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.61.": "I just checked it once\\nPressed the EOG button again",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.62.": "Alright, I’ll take another look",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.65.": "Looks like the oxygen generator’s startup program has an issue\\nNot sure why\\nIf it were COSMOS, maybe it could be started directly from the system\\nBut COSMOS is not here right now…",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.520.": "If only you could start the oxygen generator too\\nThe EOG button here is useless",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.72.": "EOG? Seems like it works on my end",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.77.": "Wait\\nHold on\\nThe oxygen generator just started\\nAmazing\\nNot sure why\\nBut it’s good news!",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.89.": "Actually, I just started it",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.618.": "No idea why, but I was able to use the oxygen generator",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.80.": "You can actually control the oxygen generator from your side?\\nForget it, now’s not the time to worry about that\\nJust start it up",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.94.": "You can actually control the oxygen generator from your side?\\nBut if you’ve successfully replaced COSMOS\\nThen having system-level permissions like COSMOS should work fine",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.224.": "Alright, time to settle the next problem",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.225.": "Go to the incubation chamber",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.226.": "Go to the engine room",

  "AliyaMessage.1-4.325.": "No\\nI just got a little burnt when I opened the door\\nthrough the gloves",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.350.": "Just be more careful! You need those hands for handling precision equipment",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.351.": "As long as you’re not hurt, just be a little more careful",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.329.": "This is all because I insisted on moving the samples first…",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.331.": "I should’ve moved faster…",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.332.": "Regretting won’t help now, let’s figure out how to solve the immediate issue",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.333.": "You’ve done great so far, and I’ll need your efforts to keep going",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.334.": "Don’t think about that now, the danger isn’t over yet",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.337.": "The problem in front of us is way too tricky!\\nForget it!",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.339.": "Thanks…\\nI can make it",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.343.": "Yeah, I need to move faster",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.346.": "I’m going in to fix the engine core",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.348.": "It’s boiling in here\\nError logs show a fault with the engine core\\nNow the pressure in the core is at a dangerously high level",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.388.": "So, what now?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.389.": "Is there a way to fix the engine core?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.390.": "Guess my decision was spot-on",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.354.": "I don’t need your \"concern\"…",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.356.": "Okay…\\nI’ll be more careful",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.363.": "Okay",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.366.": "It's not funny…\\nI’m going over to check it out",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.369.": "Hope it’s nothing too catastrophic",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.372.": "It’s the pressure cooker\\nbut, uh, the one in the engine room\\nthe pressure valve blew under high pressure",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.376.": "Luckily, it was just the pressure valve\\nI can fix this up in a bit\\nIf the whole engine core had blown, you wouldn’t be hearing from me right now\\nGood news is we don’t have to worry about the engine room anymore\\nbut the Otter might not be able to travel around freely after this\\nI’ll ignore this alarm for now",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.386.": "Still gotta deal with the oxygen generator\\n<i>Sigh</i>…\\nI’m heading there now",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.380.": "Finally\\nthe crisis is temporarily resolved\\nPhew…\\nI’m exhausted",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.382.": "Thank you, {$name}\\nwithout you\\nI honestly wouldn’t know what to do",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.411.": "No, the data shows the engine room can only hold out for another 5 minutes\\nI have to fix this big problem right now",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.394.": "There must be a way\\nbut…\\nI can’t do it…\\nmy field’s biology\\nmechanics was Kane’s specialty",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.412.": "Yeah, yeah\\nsave the bragging for later\\nwe’ve got a furnace to deal with here",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.397.": "The engine core just made another noise\\nGotta figure this out ASAP",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.402.": "Forget it… this seems too dangerous… better tackle the other issues first",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.400.": "We gotta fix the engine core. Go check the manual, maybe there’s a solution in there",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.399.": "If fixing the engine core isn’t an option, find a way to release the pressure",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.406.": "Release the pressure…\\nthat idea…\\nactually sounds doable!\\nLet me think it through a bit more…",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.408.": "I could break the pressure valve structure\\nat least that would prevent it from exploding",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.420.": "Let’s do it!",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.421.": "Breaking the pressure valve… there’s bound to be other issues from that, right?",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.410.": "No, the data shows the engine room can only hold out for another 5 minutes\\nI have to fix this big problem right now",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.417.": "Then let’s see if there’s a way to release the pressure",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.418.": "Go check if there’s a solution in the manual or something",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.442.": "This…\\nokay\\nI’ll take a look…\\nMaybe there’s something that’ll work",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.424.": "Are you sure about this?\\nBreaking the pressure valve might cause an explosion",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.426.": "Yes, but\\nI don’t exactly know if breaking the pressure valve will cause an explosion",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.428.": "It’ll be much easier to repair the pressure valve once the pressure levels stabilize",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.432.": "If I break it now, the Otter will completely lose its ability to travel\\nWe’d just be sitting here waiting for rescue",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.434.": "Just go ahead and break it then",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.437.": "Or maybe see if there’s any other way first",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.445.": "Are you sure…\\nAlright\\nI trust you\\nIt should be okay",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.447.": "I’ll check first if there’s a better solution",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.451.": "Phew…\\nthe pressure valve’s been broken\\npressure is releasing",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.615.": "Pressure levels are stable\\nI’m starting to repair the valve",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.617.": "Phew…\\nall set\\nnow the temperature in the incubation chamber should be fine too",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.604.": "All that’s left now is the oxygen generator\\nI’m heading over there",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.459.": "I found a possible solution\\nforcing the engine to start would release the pressure\\nbut under this high pressure\\nit might just cause an explosion\\nriskier than breaking the valve directly",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.460.": "Then I think breaking the valve is the safer option",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.461.": "Let’s go for it! No time to hesitate",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.464.": "Okay\\nI’m heading back to the cockpit right now",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.470.": "I’ve decided\\nI’m going back to the cockpit to switch to navigation mode",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.468.": "Engine’s prepared for ignition\\nnext up is…\\nI can feel my palms sweating",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.487.": "The divine will protect you once more",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.472.": "Have a little faith in Otter, it’ll make it",
  "PlayerChoice.1-4.473.": "Alright, hurry up, we’re running out of time",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.482.": "Yeah\\nI trust Otter\\nI’m pressing it now",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.481.": "I pressed it",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.484.": "Didn’t I say I’m a materialist?\\nForget it\\nmaybe a little prayer won’t hurt",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.486.": "I’m pressing it now",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.493.": "10%",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.495.": "40%\\nso far so good\\n80%\\nplease…\\nmake it work",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.497.": "Pressure in the engine room is normal\\npower system is running smoothly\\nthe incubation chamber temperature should be stable now\\nbut with the engine room like this\\nthe Otter probably won’t be able to travel freely from now on",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.501.": "All that’s left now is the oxygen generator\\nI’m heading over there",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.506.": "Okay\\nI'll do my best to handle the engine room\\nat least it’s not going to explode",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.508.": "I’ve decided to head to the engine room first",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.511.": "You’re right\\noxygen’s the top priority\\nhow long we can last depends entirely on the generator now",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.543.": "The generator’s running!\\nAwesome!",
  "AliyaMessage.1-4.633.": "We’ve got a signal!\\nAnd it’s an unknown one!\\nCould be extraterrestrial life!\\nTry tuning it in a bit\\nBut for now, all we can do is listen to this signal\\nIf Otter’s warp drive ever works again, we’ve gotta go check it out!\\nAnd keep an ear out on the radio too\\nmight catch something useful",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.1.": "Phew, looks like things are under control now\\nWhat a relief\\nThe Otter’s in a state where we can at least keep going\\nlike a revived Otter!\\nAll thanks to yours truly, the genius engineer!",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.2.": "Didn’t you just say you were a biologist?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.3.": "You’re an engineer?",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.5.": "Heh\\ndon’t underestimate me\\nI’ve got an eighth-level spaceship maintenance cert\\nAccording to the manual\\nan eighth-level tech can even do solo EVA repairs\\nthough I really hope Otter doesn’t end up needing anything fixed that requires a spacewalk",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.7.": "You’re eighth-level? So what level is Kane?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.9.": "Impressive, no wonder you managed to fix Otter up so well this time",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.8.": "Uh…\\nhe’s a master level\\nWell, he’s a pro at this after all\\nHonestly\\nwhat I find super frustrating\\nare just minor issues to him",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.11.": "One lucky thing this time is that Otter’s major issues were all things I could fix\\nlike, stuff I just happen to know\\nif it were any harder, I’d probably just have to watch Otter fall into Koranth 2-B\\nIt’s like the teacher set the test questions based on my revision notes\\nNext time, I might not be so lucky\\nIf I survive this time, I definitely need to hit the training courses harder\\nAnd there’s one more thing...",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.17.": "As much as I hate to admit it\\nmy dad always taught me to be straightforward\\nso, thank you\\nfor sticking with me through all this\\nand if you’re up for it...\\nI could really use your help from here on out",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.18.": "Of course, what’s the next plan?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.19.": "Alright, I’ll show mercy and do you the favor, haha",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.20.": "Call me boss and I’m in",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.13.": "As much as I want to say yes\\nhonestly, I’m still kind of freaked out",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.22.": "I refuse\\nDon’t think you can take advantage of me at a time like this",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.30.": "Alright, alright, what’s the next plan?",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.24.": "……\\nWell, that's mighty big of you",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.29.": "What’s the next plan?",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.26.": "I don’t know",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.27.": "You don’t know?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.28.": "What do you mean?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.31.": "Is there really no other way?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.66.": "Then go take a look at the warp drive",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.47.": "Don’t tell me you’re just gonna give up now",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.42.": "That’s right\\nI don’t have any ideas for what’s next",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.34.": "Right now, the best option might just be to do nothing\\nwaiting for the company to send a ship over",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.35.": "Why don’t you just get in the hibernation pod?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.49.": "Isn’t this the Mifrey mining area? Are you sure a Tayris ship can even get here?",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.37.": "Nope\\nthe Tayris manual says\\n“A spaceship must always have at least one person in an active state”\\neven during hibernation\\nto prevent accidents from going unaddressed",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.39.": "Right now, Kane’s in the pod\\nso I have to stay on standby",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.41.": "Now that Kane’s gone\\nit’s just me on this ship\\nso I have to stay on alert",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.179.": "And the hibernation pod isn’t what you think\\nIt’s more like deep sleep\\nand only lasts 3-6 months at most\\nPlus, it takes a long rehab time when you wake up",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.53.": "Will Tayris really come rescue you?",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.44.": "How would I know?",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.51.": "The Tayris manual says\\n“No matter where the danger is\\nthe company will try its best to send help”\\nBut I could be found by Mifrey first\\neither way, I should survive",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.56.": "Wouldn’t it be more convenient to just wait in the hibernation pod?",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.55.": "The manual also says\\n“No matter where the danger is\\nthe company will try its best to send help”\\nBut I could be found by Mifrey first\\neither way, I should survive",

  "AliyaMessage.1-5.68.": "It’s basically unfixable\\nit’s not even broken\\nA whole bunch of reasons\\nled it to being locked\\nand even if we bypass the surface system, we still need a series of keys to unlock it",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.70.": "I know the key, so we should be able to unlock it",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.69.": "Why was it locked in the first place?",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.73.": "You know the key?\\nNo way\\nthat joke isn’t even funny\\naren’t you from like a thousand years ago?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.76.": "Uh, it’s kinda hard to explain… let’s just try it out",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.642.": "Trust me! Go on, there’s a surprise waiting",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.74.": "Ah… well\\nbecause the communication system was damaged by a small meteorite\\nThe warp drive’s designed to be locked out when comms are down",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.641.": "I know the key, so we should be able to unlock it",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.75.": "Alright, so you don’t have any plan for what’s next?",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.79.": "Alright, the warp drive’s a bit far\\nand there are a bunch of security locks\\nit might take some time\\nI’ll message you once I’m there",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.81.": "Okay, I’ll be waiting for you",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.86.": "Remember to move fast, so you can get home sooner",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.85.": "Shouldn’t take more than a few minutes",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.89.": "Hopefully it’s just like you said\\nI’m actually getting kinda excited, haha\\nI’ll be quick",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.130.": "Alright\\nI've arrived at the warp drive\\nI've unlocked all other system locks\\nOnly the core key is left\\nSo what's the key?",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.160.": "No response\\nShould I try it again?",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.161.": "Yeah, maybe I miscalculated, let’s try it one more time",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.169.": "No, it's not necessary",
  "AliyaMessage.1-5.157.": "Still no response",
  "PlayerChoice.1-5.162.": "Let me try again",

  "AliyaMessage.3-1.200.": "Of course not!\\nSo you really could see my heartbeat all along?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-1.205.": "Not entirely\\nbut it feels weird\\nEven when I’m on a mission, if someone talks about my heartbeat\\nIt feels like an invasion of privacy\\nMaybe I’m just a little sensitive\\nCould you turn off the heartbeat monitor?\\nThe button’s labeled HRM",
  "AliyaMessage.3-1.207.": "No\\nit’s just that it bothers me\\nFeels like my thoughts are being spied on\\nPlease turn off the heartbeat monitor\\nThe button’s labeled HRM",
  "PlayerChoice.3-1.211.": "Sorry, I’ll turn it off right now",
  "PlayerChoice.3-1.212.": "It’s off",

  "AliyaMessage.3-1.215.": "It’s really off?\\nAre you sure?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-1.216.": "It’s off, would I lie to you?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-1.217.": "I’ll turn it on myself if I ever need it",
  "AliyaMessage.3-1.219.": "Alright, I trust you",
  "AliyaMessage.3-1.221.": "Uh…\\nYou wouldn’t do that",
  "AliyaMessage.3-1.223.": "right?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-2.1.": "Aliya! Are you okay?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-2.6.": "I’m fine\\nThe data tablet just got knocked over\\nDon’t worry about it",
  "AliyaMessage.3-2.8.": "Because I’m no longer Aliya",
  "PlayerChoice.3-2.9.": "What!? Could it be…",
  "PlayerChoice.3-2.10.": "Give Aliya back to me!!!",
  "AliyaMessage.3-2.13.": "Don’t ignore me! This is so awkward",
  "PlayerChoice.3-2.20.": "What!? Could it be…",
  "PlayerChoice.3-2.18.": "Give Aliya back to me!!!",
  "PlayerChoice.3-2.19.": "Alright, enough messing around, Aliya",
  "AliyaMessage.3-2.15.": "Heh heh~\\nThat’s right, Aliya’s body is now mine\\nI finally got this body\\nNow, what should I do?\\nOh yeah, I'll…",
  "PlayerChoice.3-2.21.": "Take a selfie and send it to me?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-2.29.": "Heh heh~\\nWant Aliya back?\\nBark like a dog three times, and I’ll let go of her body\\nOr else I’ll use this body to destroy the ship!",
  "AliyaMessage.3-2.23.": "Destroy the ship!\\n?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-2.25.": "What are you talking about?\\nNever mind\\nWant Aliya back?\\nBark like a dog three times, and I’ll let go of her body",
  "AliyaMessage.3-2.28.": "Destroy the ship!\\nWant Aliya back?\\nBark like a dog three times, and I’ll let go of her body",
  "PlayerChoice.3-2.31.": "Darn it! Looks like there’s no other choice… woof! Woof!! Woof!!!",
  "PlayerChoice.3-2.33.": "Alright, enough fooling around, three barks is just too much",
  "AliyaMessage.3-2.37.": "Hahaha\\nThat’s amazing!\\n{$name} totally fell for it!",
  "AliyaMessage.3-2.39.": "Tch\\nDidn’t fall for it\\nWhat a shame",
  "PlayerChoice.3-2.43.": "Alright, so what is that thing actually?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-2.44.": "Glad to see you so lively now, much better than that tense look from before",
  "AliyaMessage.3-2.47.": "Hmph\\nIf I had known from the start it was just this little guy…",
  "AliyaMessage.3-2.49.": "Hold on a sec",
  "AliyaMessage.3-2.51.": "Here\\nLook this way\\nCheese!\\nClick!",
  "AliyaMessage.3-2.55.": "",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.1.": "Cute, right?\\nSuper cute!",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.2.": "Whoa!!!! So cute",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.3.": "What is… this?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.5.": "Of course, it’s a bunny dog!",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.7.": "This is a bunny dog",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.9.": "A bunny dog?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.10.": "So you mean you were scared of this thing the whole time?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.14.": "Oh\\nIt’s normal that people from your time wouldn’t recognize it\\nIt’s an artificially bred creature\\nThough it didn’t originate on Earth",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.16.": "How was I supposed to know it was this little cutie?\\nIf I’d known it was a bunny dog, I’d have just gone in for some heavy petting\\nYou probably haven’t seen this animal either\\nIt was discovered on other planets later on\\nThough it’s been bred for many generations",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.18.": "As a pet?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.19.": "It looks like it’d be pretty popular, right?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.23.": "Yeah, some people keep it as a pet",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.25.": "Yep\\nSuper popular",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.29.": "But actually, bunny dogs are more used in mines\\nThey’re equipped with cameras to explore dangerous mine tunnels\\nOnly when the bunny dog safely returns do people move forward\\nThough the mines are risky, bunny dogs are relatively cheap",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.30.": "Cheap because they reproduce quickly?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.31.": "So, is it a rabbit or a dog?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.33.": "Not really",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.35.": "Although it's called a bunny dog, it has nothing to do with rabbits or dogs\\nDespite their cute appearance\\nbunny dogs are actually top predators on their planet\\nMost creatures there are small\\nbut bunny dogs have terrible reproductive rates\\nRelying on natural breeding would be way too slow and costly\\nSo now, except for those used in breeding experiments\\nall bunny dogs are clones",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.37.": "So why is a bunny dog here?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.38.": "How did it get on the ship?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.40.": "It’s an important sample from the breeding lab\\nSample 4782E, batch 5\\nAdapted to zero gravity\\nPart of my job is testing and verifying it\\nI should have guessed it was this little one",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.42.": "It looks like it’s doing well\\nGood thing I decided to get it out of the incubation chamber ASAP\\nOtherwise, it would’ve been frozen by now\\nThis little guy might come in handy later",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.44.": "It doesn’t look so great\\nSeems like it stayed in that ice-cold breeding lab for too long\\nThat jump at me was probably its last bit of strength\\nWish I’d taken it out of there sooner",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.46.": "Oh\\nIt just died\\nWhat a shame",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.48.": "By the way\\ndo you know why this little one ended up in the lab?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.68.": "Coincidence, maybe?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.70.": "Because of the air ducts design?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.69.": "You’re hiding snacks in the lab!",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.52.": "You don’t exactly sound heartbroken",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.53.": "Why did you say “what a shame”?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.55.": "Because it’s just a clone\\nIts genetic information is preserved\\nHumans don’t really feel attached to clones anymore\\nWe don’t even like to call clones “life”\\nThey’re more like Dolls to us\\nThough I’d like to think of it as a living creature\\nmy brain is just… numb",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.56.": "Even if it’s a clone, it’s still a life!",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.58.": "Alright, I don’t really get the customs of your time",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.57.": "You’re so cold-blooded",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.60.": "The life of a clone, huh…\\nYour view wouldn’t be widely accepted in my time\\nBut I think you’re right",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.62.": "It’s fine\\nMaybe our way of dealing with life is just… off",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.64.": "Cold-blooded…\\nis it?\\nDoes that make me cold-blooded?\\nWell…\\nNever mind, let’s change the topic",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.72.": "Not a coincidence",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.74.": "Hahaha\\nIt’s not that",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.76.": "Hahaha\\nNo way it’s that\\nHow could there be snacks in the lab\\nThough, in a way, it’s kind of related",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.78.": "You’ll know why in a second\\nLet me go grab something",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.82.": "",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.229.": "",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.83.": "This is a piece of high-purity Fresnel gem\\nRyoko would never let me touch it before\\nShe’s a stingy geologist\\nBunny dogs love the smell of this mineral\\nThat’s why it came here\\nIt’s a sample from a mining expedition\\nThis little chunk is probably worth quite a bit",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.84.": "Wow, that’s a beautiful mineral",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.85.": "So, can you sell it for cash?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.87.": "Sadly\\nthese samples we find are only for research\\nEven after research, we have to hand them over to the company\\nHonestly\\nif we could sell these,\\nwe’d all be rolling in space cash by now",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.88.": "That’s unfair",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.89.": "Makes sense, I guess",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.91.": "All these minerals are considered company property\\nAs for the explored planets and their mines\\nOnce the company confirms the value, they send a construction team to develop\\nand claim the land",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.92.": "I thought this stuff should belong to the government",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.93.": "Sounds pretty ruthless",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.95.": "Maybe that was a common thought in your time\\nIn ours…",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.97.": "We have no choice\\nSince the 26th century, companies have almost absolute power",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.99.": "Governments are basically just administrative bodies\\nThe real power lies with interstellar corporations\\nEvery new planet might have one or more governments\\nBut they all answer to the company\\nIf they can’t satisfy the company, they might just replace the leaders",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.102.": "I thought after a thousand years, society would’ve made huge progress, like achieving equality or prosperity or something",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.103.": "Sounds like you’re living in a dystopia",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.105.": "Society doesn’t move toward ideal directions\\nIt just shifts along the path of least resistance\\nPeople’s minds don’t necessarily get more advanced\\nThey’re shaped by the environment they live in",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.107.": "It’s definitely been getting harder in recent years\\nThe golden age’s growth hid a lot of problems\\nEven though resources are richer now\\nand living standards are higher than a thousand years ago\\nA lot of people still feel miserable",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.109.": "I thought the Age of Interstellar Exploration would solve the mess we’re in now",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.110.": "Then why not rise up and resist?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.114.": "At first\\nthe increase in resources did boost living standards a lot\\nBut when growth stalled, people began to realize something was wrong\\nAnd that their rights and means of power had quietly disappeared\\nIn the end, it’s not about how many resources there are\\nIt’s about who controls those resources",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.115.": "Sounds like the future’s looking pretty bleak, nothing like the progress I imagined",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.116.": "Seems hardly any different from now",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.118.": "Humans will always be humans, no matter how many years pass\\nHuman nature doesn’t progress\\nYears of social education just make us smarter, sneakier, more hypocritical beasts\\nThat’s why I prefer dealing with plants and AI",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.120.": "Maybe I should talk about something you’d be more interested in\\nSeems that you’re about to doze off",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.121.": "No grand spirit of exploration, no thriving space civilization—what’s there to look forward to?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.122.": "Actually, I’m wide awake and pretty interested in all this",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.124.": "But I don’t feel like talking about it anymore\\nI don’t know much about this stuff\\nSome of my views are probably me just rambling unconsciously\\nI never passed history or politics\\nThough, for the record\\nI aced biology",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.127.": "So, what do you want to talk about?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.128.": "Alright, I’ll just be a quiet listener",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.126.": "At least there’s interstellar warfare like in the space series you love",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.130.": "Don’t you love space series?\\nWell, there’s interstellar warfare like in those series",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.134.": "When planets are claimed and resources are fought over, conflicts are bound to happen\\nThat’s when wars break out\\nEver seen a fleet of hundreds of space carriers clashing near a stargate?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.135.": "Of course not, our generation hasn’t even left Earth",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.136.": "No, but it sounds brutal and epic",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.138.": "I haven’t seen it either\\nHahaha\\nOne good thing about future wars\\nthey mostly don’t affect us regular folks\\nWe just see it on the news\\n“Oh, there’s a fight going on a few dozen light-years away”\\nThen we go back to work",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.139.": "Now it doesn’t that feel epic at all",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.140.": "Cool",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.142.": "Because it’s not a movie\\nIt’s real war\\nand there’s no emotional pull to it\\nIt’s not about defending carbon-based dignity against silicon invaders or anything\\nIt’s just over the ownership of a mine",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.144.": "Cool? Seriously?\\nImagine it—\\na war costing billions\\nall just to fight over a mine\\nnot to defend carbon-based dignity against silicon invaders",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.148.": "Wars are brutal\\nBut for companies, it’s mainly about the huge asset drain\\nSo now they try to compete peacefully whenever possible\\nThough they still secretly want to destroy each other\\nThat’s why interstellar exploration has become a big part of the game",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.149.": "Let’s talk about something else",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.150.": "So… you’re also doing that kind of work for the company?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.152.": "Sure\\nwhat else do you want to talk about?\\nHonestly, chatting with you keeps me from going crazy\\nBeing alone in this situation is rough\\n<i>coughs</i>\\n<i>coughs</i>",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.154.": "Though I’d like to say we’re just scientists\\npushing the boundaries of human knowledge\\nThe truth is…\\nYeah, we’re doing this for the company\\nI won’t deny it…\\nMaybe…\\nmaybe we should change the topic…\\n<i>coughs</i>\\n<i>coughs</i>",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.156.": "Are you okay?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.158.": "Did the air choke you up?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.157.": "You need to drink some water",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.162.": "I’m fine…",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.164.": "As if I’d be that clumsy!",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.166.": "No, I'm all good",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.204.": "It’s nothing\\nJust a cough",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.209.": "Then let’s continue where we left off",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.210.": "If you’re fine, then I’ll log off for now",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.177.": "Alright…\\nNo\\nI still need to say it now",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.176.": "I think…\\nThe company won’t get here in time",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.179.": "What! Why?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.181.": "What’s your reasoning?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.180.": "Maybe you’re just too anxious, take it easy",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.183.": "It’s not about anxiety…\\nIt’s…",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.217.": "I…\\nIt’s not exactly easy to explain",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.186.": "You’re killing me here, can’t you just tell me?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.187.": "Alright, so if the company won’t make it, what do we do now?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.189.": "I…\\nI’m…\\nI’m worried about water and oxygen\\nThe water tank lost a lot of water…\\nMaybe the company didn’t account for this",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.190.": "This is a life-or-death situation! The company’s definitely gonna get here ASAP!",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.191.": "Alright, that’s a fair concern, so what’s the plan now?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.195.": "I just think the risk is too high\\nTo increase my chances of rescue\\nI need to stretch out my survival time",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.194.": "Head to the surface of Koranth 2-C\\nThere’s liquid water and oxygen there\\nOxygen levels are calculated to be suitable for humans\\nI could survive longer down there",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.206.": "What is it?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-3.207.": "Maybe later?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.212.": "Wait…\\nI mean\\nthere’s something I want to tell you",
  "AliyaMessage.3-3.216.": "But…\\nThere’s something else I wanted to say",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.1.": "Oxygen? Why didn’t you mention this earlier?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.3.": "But there’s gotta be a risk, right? Otherwise, you’d already be down on Koranth 2-C",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.2.": "That does sound like a better option",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.5.": "Because I wasn’t sure\\nPlus, being on the planet’s surface could delay the rescue\\nIn its current state, the Otter could even break apart entering the atmosphere",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.7.": "Yeah\\nBeing on the surface could slow down the company’s rescue efforts\\nAnd in its current condition, the Otter might break apart entering the atmosphere",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.9.": "But\\nBeing on the planet’s surface could delay the company’s rescue\\nAnd with the Otter’s current state, it might break apart entering the atmosphere",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.13.": "There’s risk, but your survival odds are way better—I support going to 2-C’s surface",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.12.": "So are you planning to just head to Koranth 2-C’s surface like this?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.11.": "Or maybe just stay in orbit around the planet and wait for rescue",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.15.": "Are you…\\nsure about this?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.47.": "Landing the Otter in its current state is extremely risky",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.27.": "Alright!\\nThen let’s head out",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.52.": "Why do you sound so excited?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.53.": "Wait, shouldn’t we inspect the ship first?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.43.": "Yes\\nFrom a risk perspective\\nIt’s a pretty reasonable choice",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.50.": "Landing the Otter in its current state is extremely risky",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.51.": "Is it really worth taking this risk?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.61.": "Actually, it’s not too bad…\\nIt's about…\\n10% chance\\nof blowing up while passing through the atmosphere\\nIf…\\nI’m truly destined to die in the Koranth 2 system\\nI’d rather go out like a shooting star\\nNot suffocate to death",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.63.": "Alright, but be careful during the landing",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.65.": "Of course!\\nI wouldn’t make it a suicide",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.91.": "A planet no one’s ever visited!\\nI might even discover new species there\\nI could write a paper when I get back",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.98.": "I've already checked\\nEverything’s running fine\\nThe only unknown is the ship’s integrity\\nAnd there’s no way to confirm that",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.95.": "Alright\\nThe Otter’s orbit is locked in\\nIt’s slowly gliding over\\nWe’ve got some time to chat",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.99.": "You’re really in the mood to chat, huh?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.100.": "What should we talk about?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.102.": "Do you know about TRPG?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.106.": "Nope",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.105.": "Yeah, that’s tabletop role-playing game",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.104.": "Sort of, like playing pretend, right?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.108.": "Players take on different…\\nroles\\nAnd there’s a dice\\nWait…\\nwhere’s my dice…\\nIt's not here\\nI’ll go look for it",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.109.": "You can roll dice in zero gravity?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.110.": "You’re gonna play now?",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.117.": "Found it\\nI didn’t realize this was an issue at first\\nSo I…\\nBrought a magnetic die\\nIt sticks to the wall",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.119.": "Wanna give it a shot?",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.128.": "Sure",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.129.": "But I don’t know how to play",
  "AliyaMessage.3-4.122.": "Found it",

  "PlayerChoice.3-4.152.": "Okay",
  "PlayerChoice.3-4.153.": "What do I need to do?",

  "AliyaMessage.Daily_2_TV.246.": "Alright, let’s go, time to get back to work\\nFirst, we need to pry open this maintenance area door",
